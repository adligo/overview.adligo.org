# Overview of Adligo.org

## Mission Statement

Adligo.org helps AI Modelers, Architects, Consultants, DBAs, DevOps Practitioners, Developers, Managers, and Testers by creating Open Source Tools, Libraries, Algorithms and Design Patterns which can be used to build, support, and administer custom software solutions.

## Tools

#### [SLink](https://github.com/adligo/slink.ts.adligo.org)

Slink is a command line tool written in Typescript that will create symbolic links for you based on entries in package.json files.  It helps facilitate Typescript and Javascript library development in Matrix Build Systems.  It will also compare the dependencies between package.json files.

#### [Tests4ts](https://github.com/adligo/tests4ts.ts.adligo.org)

Tests4ts is a Typescript (Javascript, Ecmascript) testing framework, that is compatible with JUnit XML reporting and by proxy Travis or Jenkins CI build server charts.  Example Usage is here; [https://github.com/adligo/tests4ts_example.ts.adligo.org](https://github.com/adligo/tests4ts_example.ts.adligo.org)

#### [Tests4j](https://github.com/adligo/tests4j.adligo.org)

Tests4j is a experimental Java (Kotlin, Scala, Closure, Groovy) testing framework. It has all manor of fancy features including out of the box code coverage isolation combined with concurrent test execution, circular dependency detection, Trial classification and integration with external Use-Case entry.

#### [Fabricate](https://github.com/adligo/fab.ts.adligo.org)

Is a build tool like Ant, Maven and Gradle and many others, that is currently under development.

## Libraries

Adligo.org's software libraries are all freely available on Github;
[https://github.com/adligo](https://github.com/adligo)

The convention, is that projects are Java projects if they are directly under the adligo.org package namespace.  In addition the following sub-domain name spaces exist;

*.ts.adligo.org -> Typescript Projects

*.sh.adligo.org -> Shell Scripts (i.e. Bash)

*.py.adligo.org -> Python Projects

## Algorithms

At Adligo.org when Algorithms which are identified as asymptotically interesting or important they are tracked seperate from the implementation code.

Note: [Algorithms](https://github.com/adligo/papers.adligo.com) are stored in the papers.adligo.com project.  Although they often have copyrights for some individual / academic / intelectual property protection, they are in the public domain and free to use by all.

## AML / Design Patterns

At Adligo.org we use AML (Adligo Modeling Language) to codify our Design Patterns, which is heavlily influenced / based on [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language).  We have decided not to simply use UML directly as there may be cases where we want to override or change things.  However, most concepts will remain the same, for example we will capitalize Actor Names, and Class Names.    

Note: [Design Patterns](https://github.com/adligo/papers.adligo.com) are stored in the papers.adligo.com project.  Although they often have copyrights for some individual / academic / intelectual property protection, they are in the public domain and free to use by all.

## Projects

At Adligo.org we use [Google](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management/paidmedia?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=b2c_namer_google-project-management_google_ftcof_professional-certificates_px_dr_bau_gg_sem_pr-bd_us_en_m_hyb_24-05_x) style project management, so everything is a project.  However, we started this practice in 2025, so things before that are a bit less organized than we would like.  Have a visit to our [Project Management Office](https://github.com/adligo/pmo.adligo.org) for more details.

## Community

All community discussion between developers and users occurs on our Discord channels;

## History

Adligo.org was started in 2003 at the same time Adligo Inc was founded by Scott Morgan.  The initial project [XMLT](https://github.com/adligo/xmlt.adligo.org) is a SQL injection safe SQL template engine with the ablity to use any number of optional query parameters.
